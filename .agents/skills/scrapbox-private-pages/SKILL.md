  Read from and write to private Cosense/Scrapbox projects.  Use this
  skill when a user asks to list, retrieve, or create pages in a Cosense
  project, particularly when the project is private and requires
  authentication via a `connect.sid` cookie.

# Scrapbox private project page management

## When to use this skill

Use this skill when the user needs to interact with a Cosense/Scrapbox project
by reading existing pages or creating new ones. This includes:

- Listing pages in a project.
- Retrieving a page’s metadata and body content.
- Creating a new page or appending content to an existing page.

It is particularly useful for private projects that require a session
cookie for authentication.

## How it works

The skill wraps the undocumented REST endpoints exposed by Scrapbox and
the `?body=` page creation mechanism. It provides a Python module in
`scripts/scrapbox.py` with helper functions:

- `list_pages(project_name, sid_cookie=None, skip=0, limit=100)`
  - Calls `https://scrapbox.io/api/pages/{project_name}` to fetch page
    metadata【262805452486776†L8-L29】.
  - Accepts optional pagination parameters `skip` and `limit`.
  - The `sid_cookie` parameter must be a valid `connect.sid` cookie
    string for private projects.

- `get_page(project_name, page_title, sid_cookie=None, include_text=True)`
  - Retrieves metadata via `/api/pages/{project}/{title}` and, if
    `include_text` is `True`, fetches the body text via
    `/api/pages/{project}/{title}/text`【262805452486776†L8-L29】.
  - Returns a dictionary containing both metadata and body text.

- `create_page(project_name, title, body="", sid_cookie)`
  - Creates a new page (or appends to an existing one) by issuing a
    GET request to `https://scrapbox.io/{project}/{title}?body={body}`
    with a valid `connect.sid` cookie【816266854850144†L52-L64】.
  - Requires the `sid_cookie` parameter when the project is private.
  - Raises an error if no cookie is provided for a private project.

The module uses the `requests` library and expects Python 3.8+.

## Preparing your environment

1. Install the Python dependencies (if not already available):

   ```bash
   pip install requests
   ```

2. Obtain your `connect.sid` cookie value if working with a private
   project. In your browser, open the Scrapbox project while logged in.
   Then open Developer Tools → Application → Cookies → `https://scrapbox.io`
   and find the value of the `connect.sid` cookie【334427009481422†L792-L815】.
   Decode the first `%3A` to a colon (`:`). Store this secret securely and
   never commit it to source control.

## Running the script

The script in `scripts/scrapbox.py` can be used directly from the
command line to perform simple operations. It reads the following
environment variables:

- `SCRAPBOX_PROJECT`: The project name (required).
- `SCRAPBOX_TITLE`: If set, the script will create a new page using this
  value as the title. Otherwise it will list pages.
- `SCRAPBOX_BODY`: Body content for the new page (optional).
- `SCRAPBOX_SID`: Your `connect.sid` cookie (optional for public
  projects; required for private projects).

Example: list the first ten pages of a public project:

```bash
SCRAPBOX_PROJECT=my-public-project python scripts/scrapbox.py
```

Example: create a page in a private project:

```bash
export SCRAPBOX_PROJECT=my-private-project
export SCRAPBOX_TITLE="Meeting notes 2026-02-14"
export SCRAPBOX_BODY=$'\#MTG\n参加者: Asuma\n議題:\n- '
export SCRAPBOX_SID=s:your_connect_sid_value
python scripts/scrapbox.py
```
